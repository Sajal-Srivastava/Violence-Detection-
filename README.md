# GuardEye – AI-Based Violence Detection System

GuardEye is an intelligent surveillance system that automatically detects violent activity from CCTV and video footage using Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision. The goal of this project is to improve public safety by identifying dangerous situations in real-time and reducing the need for continuous human monitoring.

The system analyzes video streams frame-by-frame and uses deep learning models to recognize patterns associated with violence such as fighting, attacking, or aggressive behavior. When suspicious activity is detected, the system instantly raises an alert, allowing quick response and improved security management.

GuardEye can be used in places like schools, hospitals, offices, public transport, and smart cities to enhance safety and prevent incidents before they escalate. The project demonstrates how machine learning and automation can be applied effectively to real-world surveillance systems.

This project focuses on simplicity, accuracy, and practical implementation, making it useful for both academic learning and real-world applications. GuardEye represents a step toward smarter and safer environments using modern AI technology.
